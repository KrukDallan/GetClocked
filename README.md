# GetClocked

A simple app that allows the user to register their working hours, also showing the overtime.

## How to compile

To compile the project:
1. On your terminal, `cd` to the project folder
2. Type `flutter run --release`, and then choose the device on which you want to run this project.

## Missing 

- Proper settings
- Possibility to interrupt the work hours for lunch or other reasons
- Appbar for pages title

## Broken

- Implementation on android seems to not be working properly. Probably is the same on iOS too, since I haven't tested it there yet.

## Notes

This is my first Flutter project, so for any problem or suggestion feel free to open an `Issue`! I'll try to answer as soon as I can ðŸ˜Š
